#Scan Match Localization.
## Setting
I develop 'c3-main.cpp' to calculate localize using a simulator in Udacity workspase environment.

## Result
I implemented both ICP and NDT method to calculate scan matiching localization.
The localizer using ICP worked and it was able to acheve the goal, but NDT. It was easy for me to adjust ICP parameters, because I could check correspoint points cloud by using visualizor and adjusted parameter unit was distance.
